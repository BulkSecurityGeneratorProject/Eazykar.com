For everything that has economic consequences, whether it is for a company, an individual or the Government - tax is relevant, as is the need for tax advisers. A career in tax has an enormous amount to offer, including variety, intellectual stimulation and an ever-changing, dynamic working environment. The complex and diverse nature of taxation means that tax advisers rapidly develop areas of specialist knowledge.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Using a tax advisor to manage your taxation affairs can be very rewarding.  Professionals are much more likely to be aware of more of the ways in which your taxes can be optimised so that you pay the least possible amount.

                    <p class="text-gray-base">Tax advisers can work in compliance, ensuring a client meets all tax obligations by preparing and submitting tax returns, tax computations and any other necessary forms. Alternatively, they may work in consultancy, advising clients on how to minimise their tax liabilities.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">The work of a tax adviser depends on the nature and size of the employer. Larger accountancy firms tend to adopt a structure that permits greater specialisation, whereas in smaller companies, the work may be more varied.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Initially, a graduate within a tax advisory role might focus on compliance activities, for example, completing tax returns and calculating the amount payable, with movement towards consultancy and specialisation as their career develops.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-base">The majority of tax advisers work for professional accountancy firms, tax consultancies and practices, and the in-house tax departments of large companies. However, there are also opportunities with banks, legal firms, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and in the finance departments of large companies. Increasingly, there are opportunities with firms in commerce and industry too. Some large companies and financial institutions have their own taxation departments and employ staff with an in-depth knowledge of the market sector. These firms offer the chance for greater specialisation and rapid promotion.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Roles in smaller firms are usually more varied but less specialised. Firms in sectors such as energy, construction, the financial services, IT and media and manufacturing offer opportunities to those who are keen to work in compliance, planning or project and advisory work. There are also opportunities in the recruitment sector.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-base">It is important to choose your accountant/tax adviser carefully. Here are a few tips to help you. If you have not used an adviser before you should be aware that anyone can call themselves an accountant/tax adviser whether or not they are professionally qualified. There are some non-qualified advisers who may have the experience to help you but qualified accountants/ tax advisers have completed relevant qualifications and will be regulated by their professional body.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Professionally qualified advisers will have achieved a qualification comprising knowledge, work experience and ethics. They keep their skills and knowledge up to date through continuing professional development and make an annual statement to their professional body that they have done so. They are also required to hold Professional Indemnity Insurance. Self-employment is an option for suitably qualified and experienced tax advisers. They usually provide a combination of tax, accountancy and financial services.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-base">Tax is a good thing – our money keeps the country running. But paying too much tax is not a good thing. Every year, UK taxpayers give away several billion pounds more than they need to. In 2016 the figure is expected to be around £4.6 billion. The government creates many legitimate opportunities for you to reduce the amount you pay in tax. However, you may not be aware of them all, or you may be unsure of how to take advantage of them – or like many people, you may have known but simply not done anything.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Tax is a complex area, and becomes more so if you run a business or have several sources of income. Numerous factors will affect the amount of tax you should pay each year, including your job, savings and personal circumstances. But for many of us, fear of paying too little tax (and the possibly consequences) means we often end up paying too much.</p>

However, there are also opportunities with banks, legal firms, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and in the finance departments of large companies. Increasingly, there are opportunities with firms in commerce and industry too. Some large companies and financial institutions have their own taxation departments and employ staff with an in-depth knowledge of the market sector. These firms offer the chance for greater specialisation and rapid promotion.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Roles in smaller firms are usually more varied but less specialised. Firms in sectors such as energy, construction, the financial services, IT and media and manufacturing offer opportunities to those who are keen to work in compliance, planning or project and advisory work. There are also opportunities in the recruitment sector.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-base">It is important to choose your accountant/tax adviser carefully. Here are a few tips to help you. If you have not used an adviser before you should be aware that anyone can call themselves an accountant/tax adviser whether or not they are professionally qualified. There are some non-qualified advisers who may have the experience to help you but qualified accountants/ tax advisers have completed relevant qualifications and will be regulated by their professional body.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-base">Professionally qualified advisers will have achieved a qualification comprising knowledge, work experience and ethics. They keep their skills and knowledge up to date through continuing professional development and make an annual statement to their professional body that they have done so. They are also required to hold Professional Indemnity Insurance. Self-employment is an option for suitably qualified and experienced tax advisers. They usually provide a combination of tax, accountancy and financial services.</p>
